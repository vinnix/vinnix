|Dockerfile Instruction	                   | Explanation                                                                                                                                     |
+------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|FROM	                                     | To specify the base image that can be pulled from a container registry( Docker hub, GCR, Quay, ECR, etc.)                                       |
|RUN	                                     | Executes commands during the image build process.                                                                                               |
|ENV	                                     | Sets environment variables inside the image. It will be available during build time as well as in a running container.                          |
|                                          | If you want to set only build-time variables, use ARG instruction.                                                                              |
|COPY	                                     | Copies local files and directories to the image                                                                                                 |
|EXPOSE	                                   | Specifies the port to be exposed for the Docker container.                                                                                      |
|ADD	                                     | It is a more feature-rich version of the COPY instruction. It also allows copying from the URL that is the source and tar file auto-extraction  | 
|                                          | into the image. However, usage of COPY command is recommended over ADD. If you want to download remote |files, use curl or get using RUN.       |
|WORKDIR	                                 | Sets the current working directory. You can reuse this instruction in a Dockerfile to set a different working directory. If you set WORKDIR,    |
|                                          | instructions like RUN, CMD, ADD, COPY, or ENTRYPOINT gets executed in that directory.                                                           |
|VOLUME	                                   | It is used to create or mount the volume to the Docker container                                                                                |
|USER	                                     | Sets the user name and UID when running the container. You can use this instruction to set a non-root user of the container.                    |
|LABEL	                                   | It is used to specify metadata information of Docker image                                                                                      |
|ARG	                                     | Is used to set build-time variables with key and value. the ARG variables will not be available when the container is running. If you want to   |
|                                          | persist a variable on a running container, use ENV.                                                                                             |
|SHELL	                                   | This instruction is used to set shell options and default shell for the RUN, CMD, and ENTRYPOINT instructions that follow it.                   |
|CMD                                       | It is used to execute a command in a running container. There can be only one CMD, if multiple CMDs then it only applies to the last one.       |
|                                          | It can be overridden from the Docker CLI.                                                                                                       |
|ENTRYPOINT	                               | Specifies the commands that will execute when the Docker container starts. If you donâ€™t specify any ENTRYPOINT, it defaults to /bin/sh -c.      |
|                                          | You can also override ENTRYPOINT using the --entrypoint flag using CLI. Please refer CMD vs ENTRYPOINT for more information.                    |
|                                          |                                                                                                                                                 |
